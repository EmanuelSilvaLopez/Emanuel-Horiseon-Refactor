## Challenges With The Starting Code.
The code used to make the origin Horiseon webpage was full of repeated code and incorrect semantic elements in the HTML. There was also very limited support for folks who use screen readers.

## The Goal of This Repository.
Refactoring the code for the Horiseon webpage CSS to reduce repeat code. Replacing the semantic elements in the origin code with more accurate description elements including: Section, Article, Header, and Footer tags. Reducing the number of classes to create a much cleaner and neat code. Using comments as well to make more sense of the code used.
